## 🚀 Quick Start

**Ultra-quick (one-liner):** 
```bash
# From anywhere in your project directory
./shared-instructions/scripts/link-shared-instructions.sh
```
That's it! Auto-detects your repo and initializes VS Code.

**Interactive mode (select from list):**
```bash
./shared-instructions/scripts/link-shared-instructions.sh --interactive
```

**Skip VS Code init:**
```bash
./shared-instructions/scripts/link-shared-instructions.sh --no-vscode
```

**Full walkthrough (3 Steps, ~20 min):**

1. **Clone & Setup (no submodules)**
   ```bash
   # Clone shared instructions once
   git clone <SHARED_INSTRUCTIONS_REPO> shared-instructions

   # Clone your project as a sibling directory
   git clone <YOUR_PROJECT_REPO> <YOUR_PROJECT>
   cd <YOUR_PROJECT>
   ```
   → Ensure `shared-instructions/` sits next to your project folder for symlinking; see `docs/GETTING_STARTED.md` for detailed setup

2. **Link shared-instructions into your repo (one-liner)**
   ```zsh
   # From your project directory - auto-detect and link with VS Code init
   ../shared-instructions/scripts/link-shared-instructions.sh
   
   # Or without VS Code init
   ../shared-instructions/scripts/link-shared-instructions.sh --no-vscode
   ```

3. **Read Team Standards**
   → See `docs/TEAM_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for workflows and guidelines

4. **Start Development**
   ```bash
   # Follow GETTING_STARTED.md step-by-step
   # You'll have a running local development environment
   ```

## 📁 How Symlinks Work

This repository uses **symlinks** for shared documentation:

```
root/
├── shared-instructions/          ← Central source of truth
│   ├── docs/                     ← Human-readable guides
│   │   ├── GETTING_STARTED.md
│   │   ├── TEAM_SETUP_GUIDE.md
│   │   └── agent-usage.md
│   ├── instructions/             ← Tool consumption files
│   │   └── copilot.instructions.md
│   ├── scripts/                  ← Setup automation
│   └── README.md                 ← This index
├── project-1/
│   └── shared-instructions/ → ../shared-instructions  (symlink)
└── project-2/
    └── shared-instructions/ → ../shared-instructions  (symlink)
```

**Benefits:**
- 🎯 Single source of truth (updates auto-sync to all projects)
- 🔄 No duplicate files to maintain
- 📚 Consistent documentation across team
- 🚀 Easy to reference from any project

**Verify symlinks are working:**
```bash
# From any project
cat shared-instructions/GETTING_STARTED.md | head -3
# Should show content from root shared-instructions/
```

## 🤖 Using AI Agents (Copilot, etc.)

Each project includes `.vscode/settings.json` that configures AI agents:

```json
{
  "copilot.instructions": [
    "shared-instructions/instructions/copilot.instructions.md"
  ]
}
```

**How to use:**
1. Open any file in your project
2. Press `⌘ + I` (Mac) or `Ctrl + I` (Linux/Windows)
3. Ask a question about your code
4. Agent reads instructions from `shared-instructions/instructions/copilot.instructions.md`

**Agent context:**
- Reads all `instructions/copilot.instructions.md` files
- Understands team standards from `docs/TEAM_SETUP_GUIDE.md`
- References usage patterns from `docs/agent-usage.md`
- Logs usage via `scripts/log-agent-usage.sh` (optional but recommended)
- Provides consistent guidance across team

## 🔄 Daily Workflow

### 1. Pull Latest Changes
```bash
git pull origin main
```

If `shared-instructions/` is a sibling directory, pull updates there too:
```bash
pushd ../shared-instructions && git pull origin main && popd
```

### 2. Create Feature Branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature/description-of-change
```

### 3. Make Changes & Commit
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "type: short description"
# See docs/TEAM_SETUP_GUIDE.md for commit conventions
```

### 4. Push & Create Pull Request
```bash
git push origin feature/description-of-change
# Create PR for code review
```

### 5. Ask for Help
```
Press ⌘ + I (or Ctrl + I)
"Help me with [task]"
Agent provides context-aware guidance
```

**See `TEAM_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for detailed workflow & standards**

## 📍 Project Locations

Your projects are organized as sibling directories (no Git submodules):

```
workspace/
├── shared-instructions/     ← You are here
│   ├── docs/
│   │   ├── GETTING_STARTED.md   ← START HERE
│   │   ├── TEAM_SETUP_GUIDE.md
│   │   └── agent-usage.md
│   ├── instructions/
│   │   ├── copilot.instructions.md
│   │   ├── magic-agent.agent.md
│   │   └── test.instructions.md
│   ├── scripts/
│   └── README.md            ← This file
├── <project-1>/
│   ├── src/
│   ├── package.json (or pom.xml)
│   └── shared-instructions/ → ../shared-instructions
└── <project-2>/
    ├── src/
    ├── package.json (or pom.xml)
    └── shared-instructions/ → ../shared-instructions
```

Replace `<project-1>` and `<project-2>` with your actual project names.
